Data Representation - 

This project visualizes the entrance data for multiple entrances to UTS Building 11 across multiple years, 
in order to show the impact of COIVD19 on the local foot traffic. The data ranges from the start of April to the start
of October each year, where the user can choose to view the data in terms of hour by hour or day by day traffic numbers.

The data shows the comparative traffic on the same day of each year, giving a good indication of the general traffic in
similar circumstances. The user is able to draw insights from this comparison, seen through the emptiness of the 2020 map, 
and the lack of entrances to the Broadway entrance during the middle of 2022.

Interactive Elements - 

Hovering the mouse over any particular entrance in any year will show an popup box with information particular to that
entrance, such as the current count within the selected interval (hour/day), the total count since the sketch began, and
the busiest day of the week for that particular entrance. 

Clicking the 'Time Scale' element in the top right of the screen will change the scale at which the sketch displays data,
from Hour to Day and vice versa.

Audio and Visual Effects - 

Hovering over a specific year will enable audio effects associated with that quadrant, including the entrance door opening
audio, and footsteps audio which changes depending on the amount of people entering at that time.

Visually, animation is achieved by the people running towards the entrances by flipping between multiple animation frames,
and a similar techinique is used to achieve animation on the entrance doors.
